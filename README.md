TripBinder ✈️📄

TripBinder is an iOS app for organizing trips, timelines, and travel documents in one place. It’s designed for people who hate digging through email threads, PDFs, and screenshots five minutes before boarding.

Trips contain timeline events (flights, lodging, activities), and each event can have relevant documents attached—boarding passes, reservations, tickets, confirmations, and more.

Built with SwiftUI, modern iOS navigation, and simple local persistence.
